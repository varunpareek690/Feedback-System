## Architecture Review
1. Organization and Admin Management:

- Organizations can be registered, and each organization has a Super Admin.
- Super Admin can add/delete other admins.
- Admins manage feedback forms on behalf of the organization.
2. Restricted Personnel:

- Only specific users (personnel) with special Access NFT tokens in their wallets are allowed to give feedback.
- Wallet addresses should not be directly linked to the identity of the personnel to ensure anonymity.
3. Feedback Form System:

- Admins create feedback forms.
- Personnel submit anonymous feedback.
- Feedback is saved on the blockchain, making it immutable and ensuring transparency.
- Feedback includes a mandatory rating field, which impacts the ranking of the subject of feedback.
- Feedback receivers (person or product) can earn additional Reward NFT tokens if their rating crosses a threshold.
4. Blockchain:

- Ethereum blockchain (or any compatible one) using Solidity smart contracts.
- Feedback contract that stores feedback data and handles NFT minting.

## Project plan
1. Requirements Clarification & Design (Week 1-2)
- Clarification:
    - Resolve anonymity issues with wallet addresses by finding a way to obfuscate wallet addresses of personnel who give feedback.
    - Design how Access NFTs and Reward NFTs will be minted and managed.
    - Decide on thresholds and rules for ranking based on feedback.

### Key Design Challenges:
- Anonymity for Feedback Givers:
    - You could consider using zk-SNARKs or ring signatures to allow anonymous transactions on the blockchain.
    - Another option is to use a mixing service that hides the wallet addresses linked to the feedback.
- Admin Management and Permissions:
    - Clearly define Super Admin and Admin privileges in the system.
__Outcome__: Create high-level diagrams (system architecture, flow charts) and finalize the tech stack.


2. Backend Development (Week 2-5)
- Database Schema (MongoDB):
    - Organization collection:
        - Org name, email, Super Admin, list of Admins (with roles), feedback form metadata, etc.
    - Access NFT holder data (list of authorized wallet addresses).
    - Feedback metadata stored in MongoDB to associate blockchain-based feedback with the org.

- Express Server Setup:
    - Set up RESTful APIs:
        - Register Organization.
        - Add/Delete Admins (Super Admin privilege).
        - Create Feedback Forms (Admin privilege).
        - Authenticate personnel via Access NFTs.
- Smart Contract Development:
    - Feedback contract:
        - Store feedback on the blockchain.
        - Handle the minting of Access NFT and Reward NFT.
        - Ensure feedback anonymity (e.g., by using wallet address obfuscation).
__Outcome__:
- Basic CRUD operations for organizations and admins.
- Working Solidity contracts for feedback storage and NFT minting.
- Feedback storage and NFT token mechanisms working on testnet.


3. Frontend Development (Week 6-8)
- React Frontend:
    - Build basic user interfaces:
        - Organization registration and admin login.
        - Admin dashboard to manage feedback forms.
        - Feedback form creation interface (restricted to admins).

- Feedback Submission UI:
    - Build the UI for personnel to fill out feedback forms.
    - Connect ethers.js to the blockchain to verify personnel wallet addresses for Access NFTs before allowing feedback submission.
- NFT Display & Ranking:
    - Build a section that displays rankings of feedback receivers (person or product) based on feedback and NFT count.
    - Implement the UI to show the effect of rating thresholds on NFT rewards and rankings.
__Outcome__:
- Basic UI/UX for the organization admins and feedback givers.
- NFT-based Authentication integrated with ethers.js.



4. Integrating Anonymity Solutions (Week 8-10)
- Implement Anonymity Features:
    - Implement zk-SNARKs (or other solutions) to ensure that feedback submission is anonymous, even though wallet addresses are used.
- Obfuscate Feedback Givers' Wallets:
    - Implement a method to obfuscate the wallet addresses to ensure admins can’t track the personnel giving feedback.
    - One approach is to use a third-party anonymization service like Tornado Cash (if the service is viable in your jurisdiction).
__Outcome__:
- Anonymity solutions integrated with feedback submission flow.
- Feedback submissions remain transparent, anonymous, and immutable on the blockchain.


5. Testing & Refinement (Week 11-12)
- Testing:
    - Functional tests for feedback forms, NFT minting, and admin management.
    - Security testing, especially for anonymity features.
    - Blockchain interactions via ethers.js to ensure data is saved correctly.
    - Test smart contract behavior on a testnet like Rinkeby.

- Feedback:
    - Refine the UX based on early user feedback.
    - Perform load testing to see how well the app scales.

__Outcome__: Fully working system ready for deployment, with all features tested thoroughly.


6. Deployment & Documentation (Week 12-13)
- Deploy Smart Contracts:
    - Deploy contracts on the Ethereum mainnet or a cheaper Layer 2 (like Polygon).
- Deploy Frontend & Backend:
    - Host frontend (React) on services like Netlify or Vercel.
    - Deploy backend (Express) on platforms like Heroku or AWS.
- Documentation:
    - Create detailed documentation for future developers, including smart contract logic and how to interact with the system.
- Outcome: System live and deployed, with proper documentation.
